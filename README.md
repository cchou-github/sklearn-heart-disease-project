# sklearn-heart-disease-project

This project aims to practice building a model that predicts whether a patient has heart disease using machine learning and scikit-learn. The Jupyter notebook file provided below contains the trained and tuned model, the model evaluation, and a comparison of feature importance. You can access the file at: https://github.com/cchou-github/sklearn-heart-disease-project/blob/main/end-to-end-heart-disease-classification.ipynb
